# utils
A bunch of bash script that provide functionality to the apple mac command line via the utils wrapper.

The command is `utils <char>` and use `utils h` to see the list of chars. It's a work in progress but i'm trying to keep it simple as possible.
The next thing to do is only ask for `sudo` when it's required.
